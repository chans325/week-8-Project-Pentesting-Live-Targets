# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 6-7 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Exploit 2.  SQL injection.  Found this on the blue target The page will redirect on the other two targets, but on this target page it will pause for the time stated in the SQL injection attack.  
Vulnerability #2: Exploit 6:  Session Hijacking.  I logged into both remaining targets the red and blue application.  Added the script to change the session to the end of the url to find out what the session id was.  Then I pulled up another browser input that same script, changed the session id to the logged in session id that I had previously found.  Then I fixed the url back to the home page and when I clicked on the login page I was automatically in the logged in portion of the application on the blue target. The red target prompted me to login. 

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Exploit 1. User enumeration.  Found this on the green target. On this page when you type in the user name that exists the reply is a bold log in was unsuccessful, but for a user name that doesn’t exist the reply is not in bold.


Vulnerability #2: Exploit 4 Cross Site Scripting.   tried to enter  <script>alert('Susan found the XSS!');</script> into the 3 applications for Globitek and the green target was one that displayed my alert after clicking on the feedback when logged in as an admin.



## Red

Vulnerability #1: Exploit 3. Found on the red target.  IDOR.  The usernames in the salesperson page are identified by id in the url.  If you change the id to 10 and 11 on this target it gives you info on people who are not working for the company right now

Vulnerability #2: Exploit 5, CSRF is on this target.  It is the only target without two vulnerabilities after completing 5 challenges already.



## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

I found the last CSRF challenge the hardest. I didn’t know what to use for the form or how to create it correctly.
